# TouchKio - Supported Hardware
This document contains an incomplete list of device and display hardware combinations that are either intended to be tested or have already been tested.

The [release](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio/releases) page has builds exclusively for **arm64** and **x64**, but custom builds for other architectures can be made (see [Development](https://github.com/leukipp/touchkio?tab=readme-ov-file#development)), allowing the application to operate on any hardware.
At least the **minimal** features, such as displaying a **kiosk window** (which doesn't necessarily need to be Home Assistant) will work.

## Hardware
If you are running Linux with a graphical user interface (Wayland or X11), you should be well equipped to use the application. Additionally, any single board computer (SBC) clones of the Raspberry Pi that operate on Raspberry Pi OS **(64-bit)** are likely to function properly as well.

## Contributions
In case your hardware is not listed above don't worry, give it a try.
Running `touchkio --web-url=https://demo.home-assistant.io` will most likely just work.
The only problems that may arise are when controlling the display via the Home Assistant integration.
